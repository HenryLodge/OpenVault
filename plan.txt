OpenVault

Encrypted command-line password and document management system.
AES-256 encryption and PBKDF2 key derivation to securely store credentials and files in an encrypted "vault" accessible only with a master password.
When putting a document in the vault, the document and metadata will be moved from its current path and put inside the encrypted vault.

Makefile line 13, used AI to help with makefile setup to add openssl flags
  - LDFLAGS_BASE=-lssl -lcrypto  ## from claude
Have no idea how to do a SETUP.sh file so I used claude to generate one
  - needed to make one because I installed openssl for this project
